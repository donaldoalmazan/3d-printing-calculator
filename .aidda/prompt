Replace material input prompt with -m flag

Replace the existing material input prompt with a -m flag that accepts a material abbreviation. The abbreviation should be matched against the materials map in the config.json file. If the material is not found, print a list of available materials and exit with an error message. The abbreviation should be case-insensitive. If multiple materials match the abbreviation, print a list of matching materials and exit with an error message.

Abbreviations should be fuzzy matched using "github.com/sahilm/fuzzy". For example, "al" and "ui" should match "aluminum". Another example is "st" and "tel" should match "steel". If the abbreviation is ambiguous, print a list of matching materials and exit with an error message.
