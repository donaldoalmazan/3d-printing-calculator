Replace material input prompt with -m flag

Replace the existing material input prompt with a -m flag that accepts a material abbreviation. The abbreviation should be matched against the materials map keys in the config.json file. If the material key is not found, print a list of available material keys and names, then exit with an error message. The abbreviation should be case-insensitive. If multiple material keys match the abbreviation, print a list of matching material keys and names, then exit with an error message.

The match must be against the material key, not the material name. The material name is only used for display purposes.
